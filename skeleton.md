# xkcd Treasure Chest

This is a collection of my favorite xkcd comics, updated on a strict interesting-xkcd-discovered schedule. All comics can be found in the `images` folder.

Accompanying is also a Python file that takes can scrapes an xkcd comic given its number and updates the images folder and this file. 

### Dependencies

You will need the following packages installed for Python 2.7:
* `urllib`
* `json`

### Use

`python scrape.py <comic_number>`
